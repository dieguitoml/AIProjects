# AIProjects
In this repository I uploaded several projects where I trained some regression models, both of supervised training and non supervised training.
Additionally, I uploaded another project where I worked with NLP in python, using word embeddings and training a model with them in order to classify news as fake or not fake. In addition, I used globe in order to do my word embeddings.
